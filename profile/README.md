Contains various Open Source Mikrotik RouterOS projects, generally focused on `/container` and scripting.  This page serves as an commented index to the more developed projects within `tikoci`.  

> See [Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/tikoci/repositories) for full list of all `tikoci`'s code and projects.

### Web Tools

* #### `diff` RouterOS commands changes between two versions
  ##### https://tikoci.github.io/restraml
  > The [tikoci/restraml](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml) project provides a web page that allows picking two RouterOS versions to see what commands have changed in the CLI or RouterOS APIs like REST.  

* #### `curl2rsc` - Convert `curl` to `/tool/fetch` 
  ##### https://tikoci.github.io/postman-code-generators
  > The project is mainly code for Postman's "Code Snippet" to support `/tool/fetch` - but hosts a web page to convert "most" `curl` commands into the right RouterOS command using `/tool/fetch`.  Various "output styles" are supported to provide examples of using `/tool/fetch` in various use cases.

* #### Observable Notebook _Mikrotik Collection_   
  ##### https://observablehq.com/collection/@a2m0/mikrotik
  Currently contains two "tools":

    * **[`utf2rsc`](https://observablehq.com/@a2m0/utf2rsc?collection=@a2m0/mikrotik)** - fun converter for emojis and UTF-8 into RouterOS `string` using byte-escaping (`\xx`)

    * **[`csv2rsc`](https://observablehq.com/@a2m0/csv2rsc?collection=@a2m0/mikrotik)** - CSV conversion into RouterOS `array` types, also an example of using a notebook to do pre-parsing of data and generate scripts

* #### RouterOS REST API Schemas (`RAML`,`OpenAPI`,...)
  ##### https://tikoci.github.io/restraml#Schema+Downloads
  > The "Scheme Downloads" is the main output of `tikoci/restraml` project.  The RouterOS REST API schemas are arranged by version and can be used in most Web API tools.  For use with **[Postman App](https://postman.com)**, see the following post on Mikrotik's Forum: [REST API schema for Postman & more](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=199476).


### Current Container Projects 

The collection includes more RouterOS containers, but the most developed are:

* **[tikoci/cligames](https://github.com/tikoci/cligames)** old BSD game collections (30+ games!) – wrapped into RouterOS container – with retro `telnet` interface.  Available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ammo74/cligames)

* **[tikoci/netinstall](https://github.com/tikoci/netinstall)**  runs Mikrotik's netinstall tool as a RouterOS container, and QEMU to enable it for ARM/ARM64.   This netinstall container uses UNIX `make` to download packages needed _automatically_ via provided `/container/env`.  Available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ammo74/netinstall)

* **[tikoci/serial2http](https://github.com/tikoci/serial2http)** wraps RouterOS "remote" serial port as an HTTP interface. Available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ammo74/serial2http)



### "Inside RouterOS" Projects 

Not all project in tikoci are containers. Projects below generally re-package, inspect, generate, or extract Mikrotik things, using GitHub Action builder.

* **[tikoci/fat-chr](https://github.com/tikoci/fat-chr)** rebuilds RouterOS CHR `.raw` package, into a valid UEFI image for UTM/Apple/other virtualization platforms.  Largely by using `fat`, instead of `ext2` for the EFI partition.  UEFI-enabled CHR images are in the [project releases](https://github.com/tikoci/fat-chr/releases)

* **[tikoci/restraml](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml)** is not a container, but builds API schemas for any RouterOS version, using [CHR in GitHub Action](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml/actions/workflows/manual-using-extra-docker-in-docker.yaml) to dynamically create API schemas from RouterOS's `/console/inspect` command.  The generated schemes can be used in Postman and other API tools to enable [RouterOS's REST API](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/REST+API) software development.  
  > This project also "hosts" the [RouterOS Command `diff` Tool](https://tikoci.github.io/restraml) via GitHub Pages, and is implemented as a "serverless, single page app" - so all the "diff'ing" and other app logic is happening in the browser without any backend server.  

* **[tikoci/postman-code-generators](https://github.com/tikoci/postman-code-generators)** contains fork from Postman adding RouterOS `/tool/fetch` snippet support & also the [`curl2rsc` website](https://tikoci.github.io/postman-code-generators)
  > The `curl2rsc` webpage takes a different approach than `restraml`.  It uses [HTMX](https://htmx.org), instead of local JavaScript events to handle UI logic.  With HTMX using a [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) backend providing a `/curl` endpoint that utilizes this project's [RouterOS "codegen" library](https://github.com/tikoci/postman-code-generators/tree/develop/codegens/routeros-fetch), with [curl-to-postman] module, to do code generation on the backend.

* **[tikoci/winbox-deb](https://github.com/tikoci/winbox-deb)** uses `Makefile` to create a `.deb` linux package with WinBox 4.0, including adding icon to desktop.  Provided mainly as an _example for others_ wanting to package WinBox 4.0 for various distros and "app stores".  
  > The `.deb` built is **not intended for wide redistribution** – more a template for future winbox packaging. 


### _Functional_ RouterOS Scripts

Various _maybe_ good examples of RouterOS scripting function:

* **[`$PIANO`](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?p=1058665)** - interactive "player piano" & studio-quality recorder using :beep

* **[`$INQUIRE`](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=197695)** - prompt user for input using arrays +**[`$CHOICES`](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=197695#p1013583)** +**[`$QKEYS`](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=197695#p1081024)**

* **[`$ROKU`](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?p=1063466)** - the missing Roku TV remote for RouterOS

* **[`$ZT2DNS`](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=204990)** - import ZeroTier Members into Mikrotik DNS, with [6PLANE](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=204990#p1078036) support 

* **[`$npushover`](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=136256#p1083224)** - send messages to https://pushover.net and providing an example of using JSON, arrays, and `/tool/fetch` 

* **[`$updateDynu`](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=208272&p1079713)** - enables updating IP to DNS mappings at https://www.dynu.com for DDNS support

* **[Track LTE Signal using The Dude](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=192103)** is not really a RouterOS function - but provides an example of The Dude's `array_element()` and `oid_column()` functions to handle name to OID mapping.

### Upcoming Projects

The following projects are in hooper:

* **RouterOS "Functional Repo"**  Various, potentially useful, scripts are littered here and [forum](https://forum.mikrotik.com).  Part of the original idea of this GitHub project was to store them, in one place, and allow simple downloads.  Eventually, more scripts will be published on  `tikoci.github.com`.

* **[Traefik Proxy](https://traefik.io/traefik/) Container _with for CORS & WASM_**  Traefik seems like a better fit for adding HTTP frontend on RouterOS, than the previous [tikoci/ngnix](https://github.com/tikoci/ngnix) approach.  While Traefik's DockerHub image work on RouterOS as-is — setup, configuration, and log viewing are [greatly aided by scripting](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?p=1081289&hilit=traefik&sid=210f6f07854850cfd0310e4666640003#p1077850).  The _longer term_ goal is to integrate Grain WASM [tikoci/traefik-wasm-grain](traefik-wasm-grain) plugin, as basis for policy enforcement for REST APIs (e.g. RouterOS REST support), using Traefik 3.0's WASM support.



### Credits and Colophon

Various repos make use of great work by others.  Specifically, and in no order:
* Both `restraml` and `curl2rsc` use a few projects and libraries that enable the page:
  * [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com) to enable a "minimal CSS framework for semantic HTML"
  * [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org)
  * [deep-diff](https://github.com/flitbit/diff)
  * [json-diff](https://github.com/andreyvit/json-diff)
  * [jsonpath](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath)
* Many repos here use RouterOS scripts.  While specific contributions are noted in the specific scripts/projects, thanks [@rextended](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=177551) & others on Mikrotik scripting forum for the many examples. 
* `curl2rsc` webpage in [`tikoci/postman-code-generator`](https://github.com/tikoci/postman-code-generator/index.html) uses [HTMX](https://htmx.org), with [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) providing a backend web service needed to run Postman's `curl-to-postman` and `postman-collection` modules under nodeJS.
* [EvilFreelancer/docker-routeros](https://github.com/EvilFreelancer/docker-routeros)'s "CHR+QEMU-in-Docker" project is used to in extracting RouterOS `/console/inspect` data from a CHR running within a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml/blob/bda495263bb4ec6c11ab460054ca2e90777104a1/.github/workflows/manual-using-extra-docker-in-docker.yaml#L37) and used by `tikoci/restraml`'s schema generation code.
* `tikoci/fat-chr` just re-builds a CHR image but relies on a script with some incantation of `qemu-img`/`gdisk` - but the scripts themselves come from @jaclaz and @kriznos, with @sindy providing QA+mgmt, in a Mikrotik [forum discussion](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=184254&hilit=eufi).
* `tikoci.github.io` uses the [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) and GitHub Pages to build this website, which will be developed more in future. 
* `tikoci/winbox-deb` is largely borrowed from @eworm and others's [Arch winbox package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/winbox), specifically the `.desktop` file.
* [Stuart Feldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Feldman), creator of original UNIX `make` & GNU's excellent [documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) covering it.  Despite `Makefile`'s being ~50 years old, it allows the nifty (IMO) containerization approach used in `tikoci/netinstall` project – which is just [66 lines of `Makefile` code](https://github.com/tikoci/netinstall/blob/master/Makefile).  And, `make` also acts the "runtime" inside the container to **both** do operations and handle options via `cmd=` or env vars.  
* In the esoteric, `traefik-wasm-grain` is an experimental [WASM plugin for Traefik](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins/666374dee8d831193077b35b/example-wasm-plugin-using-grain), built with [Grain](https://grain-lang.org) language & runs as RouterOS Traefik container - but the low-level `HttpWasm` bindings would not have been possible without help from [@ospencer]( https://github.com/ospencer).
* Mikrotik's [@mrz](https://forum.mikrotik.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=11373). Intentionally last, since it was his `/console/inspect` ["easter egg"](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=175564#p966543) clues that gave impetus to the various "schema tools" for RouterOS developed here.
