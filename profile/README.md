# `TIKOCI` — RouterOS Project Depot

Various Mikrotik RouterOS projects, generally focused on `/container` and scripting.  See each repos for details.

### Web Tools

* #### `diff` RouterOS CLI commands to see changes in commands across versions
  ##### https://tikoci.github.io/restraml
  > The [tikoci/restraml](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml) project provides a web pages that allows picking two RouterOS versions to see what commands have changed in the CLI.  
* #### `curl2rsc` - Convert a `curl` command into the 
  ##### https://tikoci.github.io/postman-code-generators
  > The project is mainly code for Postman's "Code Snippet" to support `/tool/fetch`, but a website inside the project uses [postmanlabs/curl-to-postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/curl-to-postman) to convert curl into Postman JSON, which is then converted using [tikoci/restraml](https://github.com/tikoci/postman-code-generators) convert to generate the right RouterOS command.  Various "output styles" are support on the `curl2rsc` webpage, to provide examples of `/tool/fetch` in a variety of use cases.


### RouterOS REST API Schemas (and Postman App support)

The [tikoci/restraml](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml) pages has various API schemes (RAML, OpenAPI 2.0) for RouterOS's REST API available for download.  The schemes are arranged by version, and can be used in most Web API tools, like Postman App.  Specific instruction to use with Postman App, can be found on the Mikrotik Forum: [
REST API schema for Postman & more](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=199476).


### Current Projects 

* **[tikoci/netinstall](https://github.com/tikoci/netinstall)**  runs Mikrotik's netinstall tool as a RouterOS container, and QEMU to enable it for ARM/ARM64.   This netinstall container uses UNIX `make` to download packages needed _automatically_ via provided `/container/env` on-demand.  Also available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ammo74/netinstall).

* **[tikoci/restraml](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml)** is not a container, but contains API schemas for various RouterOS versions, using [CHR in GitHub Action](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml/actions/runs/9308686567/job/25624622673) to build the schemas.  Check out the [RouterOS Command `diff` Tool](https://tikoci.github.io/restraml) to see changes in commands across versions.

* **[tikoci/serial2http](https://github.com/tikoci/serial2http)** wraps RouterOS "remote" serial port as HTTP interface.

* **[tikoci/cligames](https://github.com/tikoci/cligames)** old BSD game collections, wrapped into RouterOS container, with `telnet` interface.

* **[tikoci/fat-chr](https://github.com/tikoci/fat-chr)** rebuilds RouterOS packages, into a valid UEFI image for UTM/Apple/other virtualization platforms.

* **[tikoci/winbox-deb](https://github.com/tikoci/winbox-deb)** use Makefile to create a `.deb` linux package with WinBox 4.0, including adding icon to desktop.

* **[tikoci/postman-code-generators](https://github.com/tikoci/postman-code-generators)** fork from Postman to add RouterOS `/tool/fetch` snippet support & also supports curl2rsc website.


### Upcoming Projects

The following projects are in hooper:

* **RouterOS Function Repo**  Various, potentially useful, scripts are littered here and [forum](https://forum.mikrotik.com).  Part of the original idea of this GitHub project was to store them, in one place, and allow download.  Eventually more scripts will be published on the `tikoci.github.com` main page.

* **[Traefik Proxy](https://traefik.io/traefik/) Container _with for CORS & WASM_**  Traefik seem like a better fit for adding HTTP frontend on RouterOS, than the previous [tikoci/ngnix](https://github.com/tikoci/ngnix) approach.  While Traefik's DockerHub image work on RouterOS as-is — setup, configuration, and log viewing are greatly aided with scripting.  The _longer term_ goal is integrate Grain WASM [tikoci/traefik-wasm-grain](traefik-wasm-grain) plugin code, as basis for policy enforcement for REST APIs (e.g. RouterOS REST support), using Traefik 3.0's WASM support.
